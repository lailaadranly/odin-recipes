The goal of this project is to create a webpage using HTML. 

If completed, I will have demonstrated excellence in: 
1. Using HTML for text, to convey information 
2. Integrate links and images in my webpage
3. Redirect users to an absolute (another website) or relative page (another page in the website/directory)

Getting 1 step closer towards web development!
