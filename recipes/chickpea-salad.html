            <h3>Description</h3>
        </p>
        <p>
            Thanks to the chickpeas, this salad will keep you full for hours. It's satisfying in a way that leafy greens never could be. Sorry not sorry, kale.         </p>
        <p>
            Canned beans are a real lifesaver when it comes to our favorite pantry staples. Each standard 15-oz. can comes packed with fiber and protein, providing a 1-2 punch of real affordable nutrition in the 30 seconds it takes to crack open a can, drain, and rinse. They can be eaten straight from the can, making this a very summer-friendly recipe on those hot, hot days when you just can't be bothered to turn on the heat. We know that this is a "chickpea salad", but you can totally switch out chickpeas for your favorite canned beans: creamy cannellini beans, black beans, kidney beans are all great options.        
        </p>
        <p>
            Our lemon-parsley vinaigrette is perfectly tart and fresh with a hint of spice and you can put it on everything. This means that if you want to switch out any of the salad ingredients for your preferred addition, you have our blessings. Not a fan of olives or bell peppers? Cherry tomatoes and diced ripe avocado will fill that flavor gap. Want to keep it dairy free? Sub in another form of protein in place of the feta, like a couple of hard-boiled eggs or a can of tuna, or a handful of chopped toasted nuts. If you have any extra dressing left over, store it in an airtight container in the fridge for up to 10 days.
